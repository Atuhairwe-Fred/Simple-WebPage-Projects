    <h1 id="title">Coconut Cardamom Mandazi <br>(East African Beignets)</h1>
    
    <p id="about">Mandazi is a popular East African snack, especially in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. These soft and slightly sweet fried dough triangles are similar to doughnuts but lighter, often made with coconut milk and warm spices like cardamom. <br>They’re perfect for breakfast, tea-time, or as a quick treat. Mandazi can be enjoyed plain or paired with tea, coffee, or even sprinkled with powdered sugar.</p>
