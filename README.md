# Simple-WebPage Projects

This repository contains **self-made web projects** built using HTML and CSS. Unlike my main [course](https://github.com/Atuhairwe-Fred/My-Web-Dev-Learning-Journey) files, these projects are **independent experiments**, showcasing practical application of my skills and creativity.  

## Purpose

- Transform HTML pages previously created during my learning journey into fully styled, visually appealing projects.  
- Experiment with layouts, design, and CSS techniques outside the structure of a course.  
- Build a personal portfolio of small, standalone projects that demonstrate practical web development skills.  

## Structure

Each project has its own folder containing:  
- `index.html` – The main HTML page for the project.  
- `style.css` – CSS styling for the page.  
- `assets/` – Optional folder for images, fonts, or other resources.  

## Approach

1. Start with HTML pages created during my course on [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org).  
2. Apply CSS to improve layout, design, and visual appeal.  
3. Experiment with different techniques, iterating independently from course exercises.  
4. Enhance HTML structure as needed to support new designs and features.  

## Tech Stack / Skills Learned

- **HTML** – Structuring pages using semantic elements, nesting, attributes, and inline vs. block elements.  
- **CSS** – Styling text, layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and simple responsive designs.  
- **Workflow** – Organizing projects, linking CSS to HTML, and using a version control system (GitHub) to track progress.  

## Notes

This repository is a **sandbox for experimentation and learning**, meant to show real-world application of HTML and CSS skills rather than following strict course instructions. Projects will be updated and improved over time as new techniques are learned.
